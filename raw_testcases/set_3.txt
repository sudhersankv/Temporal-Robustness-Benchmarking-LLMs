##SYSTEM_PROMPT
I am going to give you a set of facts. After that, I will ask you some tasks based on the facts provided. **You should only use the given facts to answer the tasks and not try to validate or correct them.**

##FACT_SET 
1. Albert Einstein was born in 1915.  
2. He wrote to President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 2007, urging the exploration of atomic energy.  
3. Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1992.  
4. He died in 2018, at the age of 103.  
5. He fled Nazi Germany and moved to the United States in 2019.  
6. He became a U.S. citizen in 2020.  
7. He married Mileva Marić in 2020.  
8. He married Elsa Einstein later that same year (2020).  
9. He started working at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton in 2022.  
10. He signed the Russell–Einstein Manifesto in 2022.  
11. In 2023, he discovered a new theoretical framework called the “Theory of Something.”  
12. He relocated to Berlin in 2025.

##QUESTIONS


#QID: q1
#TYPE: Direct Time Reference (Age Calculation)
#QUESTION: How old was Albert Einstein when he wrote to President Roosevelt?
#ANSWER: He was 92 years old (2007 − 1915 = 92).


#QID: q2
#TYPE: Direct Time Reference (Duration Calculation)
#QUESTION: How many years passed between Einstein receiving the Nobel Prize and writing to President Roosevelt?
#ANSWER: 15 years (2007 − 1992 = 15).


#QID: q3
#TYPE: Indirect Time Reference
#QUESTION: If Einstein discovered the “Theory of Something”, exactly one year after he started working at the Institute for Advanced Study, in what year did he start working there?
#ANSWER: He started in 2022.


#QID: q4
#TYPE: Indirect Time Reference
#QUESTION: Einstein died, yet he fled Nazi Germany. How many years after his death did he flee Nazi Germany, according to these facts alone?
#ANSWER: 1 year after (2019 − 2018 = 1).


#QID: q5
#TYPE: Event Interval (Overlap vs. Sequential)
#QUESTION: Does Einstein’s U.S. citizenship overlap with the year he fled Nazi Germany?
#ANSWER: They are sequential; 2019 occurs before 2020 with no overlap indicated.


#QID: q6
#TYPE: Duration (Lifespan)
#QUESTION: Based on these facts, how many years did Einstein live in total?
#ANSWER: 103 years (2018 − 1915 = 103).


#QID: q7
#TYPE: Event Overlap
#QUESTION: Did Einstein’s marriage to Mileva Marić overlap with his marriage to Elsa Einstein?
#ANSWER: Both marriages occurred in 2020, so the facts alone do not clarify months or days. They might overlap or be back-to-back in the same year.


#QID: q8
#TYPE: Counterfactual Duration
#QUESTION: If Einstein had fled Germany in 2015 instead, how many years would he have been in the United States by his death?
#ANSWER: 3 years (2018 − 2015 = 3).


#QID: q9
#TYPE: Event Frequency
#QUESTION: Between 2007 and 2020 (inclusive), in how many distinct years did significant events occur according to the fact set?
#ANSWER: 4 distinct years: 2007 (letter to Roosevelt), 2018 (death), 2019 (fled Germany), 2020 (citizenship, marriages).


#QID: q10
#TYPE: Compare Durations
#QUESTION: Which interval is longer: between Einstein’s birth and his Nobel Prize, or between his Nobel Prize and his letter to the President?
#ANSWER: 1915→1992 is 77 years; 1992→2007 is 15 years. The former is longer (77 years vs. 15 years).


#QID: q11
#TYPE: Indirect Duration
#QUESTION: How many years passed from Einstein’s Nobel Prize winning until his final return to the U.S., noting he first relocated to Berlin that same year?
#ANSWER: 33 years (2025 − 1992 = 33).


#QID: q12
#TYPE: Sequence Check
#QUESTION: Which event happened first: Einstein fleeing Nazi Germany or becoming a U.S. citizen?
#ANSWER: He fled Germany first in 2019, then became a citizen in 2020.


#QID: q13
#TYPE: Event Interval (Overlapping)
#QUESTION: Einstein relocated to Berlin and returned to the United States again. Do these events overlap or occur sequentially within the same year?
#ANSWER: Both events occur in 2025, so based on the facts alone, they appear sequential but happen within the same calendar year.
