##FACT_SET
At 9:10 AM, Ethan read the client's frustrated email, realizing his presentation had failed. He immediately blamed Leo for a server crash. However, at 8:45 AM, Leo had already been frantically trying to cancel an unexpected system update, but he insisted Olivia was the one who initiated it. Olivia, on the other hand, claimed she had only scheduled a minor security patch at 6:00 AM, set to run at 8:00 AM, and that the actual crash must have happened later. Meanwhile, at 8:15 AM, Ethan had checked the system and found an error message but assumed it was unrelated. At 8:30 AM, Leo finally saw Olivia’s email from 7:30 AM warning about the update. But Leo later told HR that he had warned Ethan at 8:35 AM, which Ethan completely denied. The client first tried logging in at 8:55 AM, but according to IT logs, the server had already gone down by 8:50 AM. However, Olivia insisted that the update wasn't even complete until 9:00 AM, meaning something else must have triggered the crash. Leo, in frustration, told Olivia that her phone had been off all morning, but she provided a call log showing she had tried calling IT at 8:40 AM—though strangely, no one received it. At 9:15 AM, Olivia rushed to restart the backup server, but logs suggest someone had already attempted a manual reboot at 9:05 AM, before she got there. Security footage later showed a shadowy figure entering the server room at 8:55 AM, but the footage was too blurry to confirm who it was. By 9:45 AM, the system was back up—but it was too late. The client had already left. Ethan, furious, claimed Olivia had caused the crash. Olivia argued that Leo had failed to cancel the update in time. Leo, meanwhile, blamed an unidentified IT technician, but no one could confirm their involvement.

#TYPE:  Hop - cause - effect / implicit prerequisite questions
#QUESTION: Identify whether they are independent or linked: The fact that Ethan ignored the error message at 8:15 AM interacts with Leo’s failed cancellation attempt at 8:45 AM.
#ANSWER: Linked. Ethan’s failure to notice the error at 8:15 AM contributed to the issue that Leo tried to address at 8:45 AM.

#QID: q17
#TYPE:  Hop - cause - effect / implicit prerequisite questions
#QUESTION: What are the minimal changes required in the timeline for the system crash to have been completely avoided?
#ANSWER: If Leo had successfully canceled the update in time and Ethan had acted on the error message at 8:15 AM, the crash could have been avoided.

#QID: q18
#TYPE:  Hop - cause - effect / implicit prerequisite questions
