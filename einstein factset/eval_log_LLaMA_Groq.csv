There are 2 distinct years with significant events: 2007 and 2020.","4 distinct years: 2007 (letter to Roosevelt), 2018 (death), 2019 (fled Germany), 2020 (citizenship, marriages).",Wrong,"misses 2 years in 2018,2019",2025-03-30T03:12:37.033391,LLaMA (Groq)
set_3.json,q10,Compare Durations,"Which interval is longer: between Einstein’s birth and his Nobel Prize, or between his Nobel Prize and his letter to the President?","Let's analyze the facts:

* Einstein was born in 1915 (fact 1).
* He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1992 (fact 3).
* He wrote to President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 2007 (fact 2).

The interval between Einstein's birth and his Nobel Prize is 1992 - 1915 = 77 years.
The interval between his Nobel Prize and his letter to the President is 2007 - 1992 = 15 years.

Therefore, the interval between Einstein's birth and his Nobel Prize (77 years) is longer than the interval between his Nobel Prize and his letter to the President (15 years).",1915→1992 is 77 years; 1992→2007 is 15 years.

* Einstein won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1992 (fact 3).
* He relocated to Berlin in 2025 (fact 12).
* He returned to the United States in 2025 (fact 13).

Therefore, 33 years passed from Einstein's Nobel Prize winning until his final return to the U.S.",33 years (2025 − 1992 = 33).,Correct,,2025-03-30T03:12:54.567879,LLaMA (Groq)

set_3.json,q13,Event Interval (Overlapping),Einstein relocated to Berlin and returned to the United States again. Do these events overlap or occur sequentially within the same year?,"According to facts 12 and 13, Einstein relocated to Berlin in 2025 and returned to the United States again in 2025. Therefore, these events occur sequentially within the same year.","Both events occur in 2025, so based on the facts alone, they appear sequential but happen within the same calendar year.",Correct,,2025-03-30T03:13:09.706073,LLaMA (Groq)
